# Expectation-Maximization-Gaussian-Mixtures

**EM-for-gmm**

The goal of this notebook is to 
* implement the EM algorithm for a Gaussian mixture model
* apply your implementation to cluster images
* explore clustering results and interpret the output of the EM algorithm  


**EM-with-text-data**

The goal of this notebook is to 
* use an EM implementation to fit a Gaussian mixture model with **diagonal** covariances to a subset of the Wikipedia dataset.
